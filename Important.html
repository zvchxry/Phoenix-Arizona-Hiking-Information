		<h2>Important information regarding hiking in Arizona</h2>
			<p> Hiking in Arizona, especially in Phoenix, can be some of the most fun you'll ever have. There are some extremely important things to consider through, especially in the summer time. </p> 
		<ul>
			<li>In the summertime, temperatures can rise up to 117 degrees Fahrenheit! Under no circumstances should you be hiking during the day. Yearly there are <a href="http://www.pinalcentral.com/san_tan_valley_sentinel/health_and_wellness/summer-hiking-dangers-officials-frustrated-by-rash-of-deaths/article_a940f320-2f32-11e5-b80d-8b651e9acd2f.html">multiple deaths</a> relating to people who hike during brutal summer days.</li> 
			<br>
			<li>With extreme heat comes extreme sweat. There's no way around this, so dressing appropriately to sweat will make an extreme amount of difference.</li> 
			<br>
			<li>According to this <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256">Mayo Clinic article</a>you should be drinking about 3 liters of water for men (13 cups) and 2.2 liters for women (9 cups) per day. The <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256?pg=2">next article </a> gives more information about exercise and appropriate amounts of water to drink during those activities.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Listen to your body. If you're feeling tired, take a break in some shade or just turn around. Pushing yourself is how accidents happen. If you become confused, forget where you are, or start to feel faint, immediately call for help.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Turn around once the water you've brought reaches halfway. If you do not stay hydrated it is very easy to pass out.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Tell someone where you plan to go and what time, just in case something happens to you. Maybe they can offer you advise or make you rethink your decision if it sounds bad!</li>
			<br>
			<li>Stay on marked paths. They're there not only to guide you, but to help save precious wildlife and endangered plants. If you decide to do stray away, heavy fines or even punishment from law enforcement could occur.</li>
			<br>
			<li>If dogs are allowed on the trail, please pick up their poop. Nobody likes stepping in that, and it's already a privilege that our dogs can enjoy the trails with us. Let's work hard to keep it that way!</li>
