		<h2>Dixie Peak summit trail</h2>
			<p> <p>Dixie Peak summit trail is a fun, but hard work out. Only having a few switchbacks, rocky and steep areas, this is a good hike to start off with if you're tired of doing easy trails. The reward is gorgeous views of Camelback and the northern part of the valley. Located within the Phoenix Mountains Preserve, there are multiple other trails that can be completed within the area. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This area is also bike friendly on the flat trails, but no bikes are allowed on the actual trails leading to the summits. There is free parking at the address listed below, and along N 40th St. No dogs are allowed in the Phoenix Mountains Preserve. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I would suguest wearing athletic/hiking gear, and bringing water and food. This is a big park with lots of trails, so it's best to come prepared if you want to stay for awhile. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The parking situation is a paved parking lot, and you can park along N 40th street in zones that have no "do not park here" signs. You should get here early on the weekends if you want to snag a parking spot, or else you'll be forced to walk from the street (which isn't too terribly bad).
