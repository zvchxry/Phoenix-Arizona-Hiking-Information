		<h6> The view from the top of Tempe Butte or "A" mountain in Tempe, Arizona. </h6>
		<h2>Tempe Butte trail</h2>
			<p> <p>To get one of the best views in Tempe, Tempe butte trail is a must stop destination. Overlooking Arizona State University to the south and Tempe town lake to the north, breathtaking views of the valley await at the top of this very easy and popular hike.
			<br>
			<br>
			This is only a small taste of the outdoors Arizona has to offer. If you're struggling with this trail, hiking may not be for you, as this is the easiest hike on the list. This is also a dog friendly trail (must be on a leash), and it is paved until the last section of the hike. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I'd suguest water and mostly any clothes (other than formal, dresses or flip flops) as this trail won't give you too much trouble, but be prepared to sweat lightly. The address listed below is a paid parking lot, make sure to pay as they will be more than happy to give you a ticket!
