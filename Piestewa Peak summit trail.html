		<h2>Piestewa Peak summit trail</h2>
			<p> <p>Piestewa Peak summit trail is another extremely difficult trail, but not as challenging as Camelback. Switchbacks, possible drops, and multiple rocky sections; this trail is challenging. After a strenuous workout, the trail rewards you with views of the north side of Camelback mountain, million dollar homes, and the northern side of Scottsdale/Paradise Valley. 
			<br>
			<br>
			It offers similar views to Dixie trail summit, but is more challenging if that's what you're looking for. This trail is also in the Phoenix Mountains Preserve, so if you decide that it is too strenuous there are multiple trails that offer spectacular views within the park.
			<br>
			<br>
			There is free parking for this trail at the address listed below. Unfortunately, this trail and Phoenix Mountains Preserve does not allow dogs, but it would be hard on the animal. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Like the other trails, hiking/athletic shoes and clothes should be worn. Water is essential to survival on this trail. Please remember, just turn around if you're not feeling good. It's better to go back then have to go to the hospital or potentially die because you don't want to give up!
