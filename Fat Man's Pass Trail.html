		<h6>The gap between 2 boulders at Fat Man's pass<h6>
		<h2>Fat Man's pass</h2>
			<p> <p>Somewhat of a more hidden trail, Fat Man's pass is a very fun and rewarding hike (or more so area), if you can find it. You will need to go to the address listed below, and take note that it does have limited parking. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Once you've arrived, head towards National trail. Continue on the trail for about 1.5 miles until you reach the split between the National trail and the Hidden Valley trail. Head towards the Hidden Valley Trailhead and you should see smooth boulders with a space between them. You are now at Fat Man's pass! If you can't find it, don't hesitate to ask another hiker. Most are friendly and more than willing to help you find this unique trail.
			<br>
			<br>
			South Mountain is very dog friendly, but I wouldn't bring them on this particular hike. It gets very narrow and would be harder for a larger dog. There are some areas that are very tight, like I said in the discription below if you are claustrophibic this one isn't for you. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I'd wear the typical gear of hiking/athletic clothes, water, and some snacks. The parking situation is a paved parking lot, which is free. During the weekends it will get very busy, and there is a potential of not getting a spot.
