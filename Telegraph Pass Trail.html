		<h2>Telegraph Pass Trail</h2>
			<p> <p>Telegraph Pass Trail is another good starter trail if you're not in the best shape or just starting out hiking! This trail can be completed by anyone, and provides a cool view of the Southside of South Mountain. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In addition, this trail is wheelchair accessible - to a certain point. The first half mile is all paved, but then it turns into dirt and rock where a wheelchair would have to stop. There are 2 other trails that also start from this one, the first being close to the ending of the paved area and the other at the summit close to the road.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you're looking for dog friendly hiking, this is the trail for you. While I was hiking on the trail, I saw multiple dogs (big, small, older) and they were all doing just fine. Make sure to bring extra water and doggie bags for their poop! Nobody likes a dirty trail, and it is a privilege to be able to bring our animals along to enjoy nature. 
			<br>
			<br>
			There is free parking at the address below, but it is limited. If you're going on the weekend, I'd suggest arriving earlier to ensure you get parking. This trail also allows bikes on the paved area. Once again, water and hiking/athletic shoes and clothing are essential.
